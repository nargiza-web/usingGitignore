Use this as an example of using git ignore.

$ sudo npm install gitignore -g
//Installs gitignore as a global command.

$ touch .gitignore 
//create a gitignore file inside of your working directory. This needs to be done in the most parent root.

Using your code editor, open the file (files beginning with . are hidden by default.)

Write the files into the .gitignore file you wish to ignore.

Run through the normal git commands. (git commit and push)
